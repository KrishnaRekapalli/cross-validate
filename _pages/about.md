I am Krishna. I write code for a living. I am a full-stack Data Scientist working at IBM building data science applications for Agriculture and Utility industries using Geo-Spatial data. I am passionate about Open Source technologies, Education and Healthcare. I volunteer in my free time at Statistics Without Borders doing Data Science projects. This purpose of blog is partly notes to myself and partly to share my learnings with rest of the community. 



This website is powered by **[fastpages](https://github.com/fastai/fastpages)** [^1]. Thanks to Hamil and Jeremy for making the blogging process much easier for all of us.
